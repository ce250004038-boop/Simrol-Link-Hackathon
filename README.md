## 🧐 Problem Statement
Commuting from **IIT Indore (Simrol)** to Indore city (C21, Railway Station, Airport) is expensive and chaotic. Students often struggle to find peers to share cabs with, leading to:
* Paying ₹800+ for a solo cab ride.
* Spamming multiple WhatsApp groups to find partners.
* Safety concerns when traveling with strangers.

## 💡 The Solution: Simrol-Link
**Simrol-Link** is a centralized, hyper-local carpooling web application designed specifically for the IIT Indore community. It connects students heading to the same destination, allowing them to split costs and travel safely with verified batchmates.
